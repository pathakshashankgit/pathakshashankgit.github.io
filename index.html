<h2> About me </h2>
<p>Hello. I am a mathematics student currently pursuing MS from IISER Bhopal. I am interested in the field of Automated Theorem Proving.</p>

<h2> Slides </h2>
<p>Here you will find all the slides of my seminars.</p>
<p>This is what I am doing as a part of my MS Thesis. It deals with axiomatizing modal logics of spaces.
 <a href="Seminar 2.pdf"> Topological Completeness of S4</a></p>
<p>This is something we (Me and my friend Prasanna) presented in 8th Indian School on Logic and its Applications (ISLA 2020) on the last day as a part of Student's presentations. In this we describe what is Automated Theorem Proving, and describe the Robbins conjecture whose proof was found by an automated theorem prover EQP.
